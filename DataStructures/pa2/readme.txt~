=============================== Questions ===================================

1. Using your "crack" program, decipher the following intercepted message:
             Ljnbja'b bnlanc bjujm anlryn

: Caesar's secret salad recipe

2. Read the section "Examples and Caveat" on the assignment webpage.
Find an English term, phrase, or sentence other than 
"Rhythm & Blues" that the crack program cannot handle correctly. It should
contain at least 8 letters. Please avoid place names / proper names like
"Tarzana" or "Ziggie".

English message : I found that the crack program cannot handle correctly
"Potato" and "Blueberry".

Result of encoding and then cracking it : "Potato" = "Onszsn" and
"Blueberry" = "Oyhroreel"

3. (Optional) Did you add any extra functions to caesarlib.h and 
caesarlib.cpp for your convenience? If so, briefly explain.

:No, I didn't add any extra functions.

================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

:Three days

Do you have any feedback about this assignment?

:Yes, I didn't know that const char filename[] would accept argv[1] because
we learned in lecture that we could only compile a char array when the size
was given in the declaration of the array. I thought that I we had to do
dynamic allocation of memory, but in the Q&A section it was instructed not
to use dynamic memory allocation. Therefore, I got stuck and I didn't know
what to do because arv[1] is a char [] and filename [] is a const char
type. A char[] and a const char are not the same.

In addition, in lecture we only covered header files in two examples on
creating objects, the alarm clock and the Deck class. I didn't know that
header files could be used as a way of communicating between two cpp files.
I thought that a header file was only used for objects, since that is what
it was covered in lecture and it is what it is covered in the book. Even
after reading the book, I thought that the only purpose of a header file
was to create an object, since the only examples used in the book where
objects.

Finally, it would have been helpful if PA2 was explained during lecture as
the same as PA1.

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful
to know if you turned it in incomplete.

:Yes, problems in understanding how to pass the argv[1] into a const char
array and the understanding a header file.

Do you have any other remarks?

:Yes, sometimes the instructions on how to use the functions that are given
in the skelleton are hard to understand. A longer description of the
functions that are given would be helpful.
