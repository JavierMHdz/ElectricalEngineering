: CP on Tuesday and tutors
=============================== Prelab ==================================

1. What data structure will you use to remember which cells have
already been added to the queue or not?

: boolean 2D array named visitedCells in my program.

2. At what step of the BFS algorithm do you have to mark a cell as visited?

: As I walk through the neighbors of the current location, I mark them as visited.

=============================== Review ==================================

1. Describe your "mymaze.txt" test file. It should have multiple paths
of different distances. When you ran your program on it, did your program 
behave as expected?

: Yes, it had two possible paths.
One is 10 steps long and the other one is 8 steps long.
At the end, it only prints the shortest path (the path that is 8 steps long).
